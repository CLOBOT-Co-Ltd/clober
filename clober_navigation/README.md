# Clober Navigation
**Clober may move & rotate for navigation. Make sure you are operating in a safe environment**

Navigation is to move a robot from one location to a specified destination of the given environemnt. For the purpose, a map containing the geometrical information of the robots surroundings is required.

[*SLAM of the environment allow you to acquire a map*](https://github.com/clobot-git/clober/tree/noetic-devel/clober_slam)

## 1. Run Navigation Nodes
### 1.1 Bringup Robot
1. Run a `Bringup` for the Clober.
  ```bash
  roslaunch clober_bringup base.launch
  ```
- This can be substituted by running a simulation node
  ```bash
  roslaunch clober_simulation logo_world.launch
  ```

### 1.2 Launch Navigation
```bash
roslaunch clober_navigation navigation.launch
```

## 2. Estimate Initial Pose
Initial Pose Estimation can be performed before Navigation to intialize AMCL parameters which are critical to Navigation quality. 
  1. Click `2D Pose Estimate` Button on the RVIZ menu
    <img align="center" src="https://github.com/clobot-git/testrobot/blob/noetic-devel/images/2d_pose_estimate.png">

  2. Click on the map where clober is located and drag the green arrow toward the dirction the robot is facing.

  3. Repeat step 1 and 2 to increase data precision.

  4. Launch keyboard teleoperation to further increase precision.
    ```bash
    rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
    ```

  5. Move the robot back and forth in order to narrow down the estimated location.

  Trajectory Configuration Parameters


### dt_ref (double, default: 0.3)
  Desired temporal resolution of the trajectory (the trajectory is not fixed to dt_ref since the temporal resolution is part of the optimization, but the trajectory will be resized between iterations if dt_ref +-dt_hysteresis is violated.


### dt_hysteresis (double, default: 0.1)
  Hysteresis for automatic resizing depending on the current temporal resolution, usually approx. 10% of dt_ref is recommended


### min_samples (int, default: 3)
  Minimum number of samples (should be always greater than 2)


### global_plan_overwrite_orientation (bool, default: true)
  Overwrite orientation of local subgoals provided by the global planner (since they often provide only a 2D path)


### global_plan_viapoint_sep (double, default: -0.1 (disabled))
  If positive, via-points are extrected from the global plan (path-following mode). The value determines the resolution of the reference path (min. separation between each two consecutive via-points along the global plan, if negative: disabled). Refer to parameter weight_viapoint for adjusting the intensity. New in version 0.4


### max_global_plan_lookahead_dist (double, default: 3.0)
  Specify the maximum length (cumulative Euclidean distances) of the subset of the global plan taken into account for optimization. The actual length is than determined by the logical conjunction of the local costmap size and this maximum bound. Set to zero or negative in order to deactivate this limitation.

## Obstacle Parameters
### min_obstacle_dist (double, default: 0.5)
  Minimum desired separation from obstacles in meters


### include_costmap_obstacles (bool, default: true)
  Specify if obstacles of the local costmap should be taken into account. Each cell that is marked as obstacle is considered as a point-obstacle. Therefore do not choose a very small resolution of the costmap since it increases computation time. In future releases this circumstance is going to be addressed as well as providing an additional api for dynamic obstacles.


### costmap_obstacles_behind_robot_dist (double, default: 1.0)
  Limit the occupied local costmap obstacles taken into account for planning behind the robot (specify distance in meters).


### obstacle_poses_affected (int, default: 30)
  Each obstacle position is attached to the closest pose on the trajectory in order to keep a distance. Additional neighbors can be taken into account as well. Note, this parameter might be removed in future versions, since the the obstacle association strategy has been modified in kinetic+. Refer to the parameter description of legacy_obstacle_association.


### inflation_dist (double, default: pre kinetic: 0.0, kinetic+: 0.6)
  Buffer zone around obstacles with non-zero penalty costs (should be larger than min_obstacle_dist in order to take effect). Also refer to the weight weight_inflation.


### include_dynamic_obstacles (bool, default: false)
  If this parameter is set to true, the motion of obstacles with non-zero velocity (provided via user-supplied obstacles on topic ~/obstacles or obtained from the costmap_converter) is predicted and considered during optimization via a constant velocity model. New


### legacy_obstacle_association (bool, default: false)
  The strategy of connecting trajectory poses with obstacles for optimization has been modified (see changelog). You can switch to the old/previous strategy by setting this parameter to true. Old strategy: for each obstacle, find the nearest TEB pose; new strategy: for each teb pose, find only "relevant" obstacles.


### obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor (double, default: 1.5)
  The non-legacy obstacle association strategy tries to connect only relevant obstacles with the discretized trajectory during optimization. But all obstacles within a specifed distance are forced to be included (as a multiple of min_obstacle_dist). E.g. choose 2.0 in order toenforce the consideration obstacles within a radius of 2.0*min_obstacle_dist. [This parameter is used only if parameter legacy_obstacle_association is false]


### obstacle_association_cutoff_factor (double, default: 5)
  See obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor, but beyond a multiple of [value]*min_obstacle_dist all obstacles are ignored during optimization. Parameter obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor is processed first. [This parameter is used only if parameter legacy_obstacle_association is false]


## The following parameters are relevant only if costmap_converter plugins are desired (see tutorial):
### costmap_converter_plugin (string, default: "")
  Define plugin name in order to convert costmap cells to points/lines/polygons. Set an empty string to disable the conversion such that all cells are treated as point-obstacles.


### costmap_converter_spin_thread (bool, default: true)
  If set to true, the costmap converter invokes its callback queue in a different thread.


### costmap_converter_rate (double, default: 5.0)
  Rate that defines how often the costmap_converter plugin processes the current costmap (the value should not be much higher than the costmap update rate) [in Hz].


## Optimization Parameters
### no_inner_iterations (int, default: 5)
  Number of actual solver iterations called in each outerloop iteration. See param no_outer_iterations.


### no_outer_iterations (int, default: 4)
  Each outerloop iteration automatically resizes the trajectory according to the desired temporal resolution dt_ref and invokes the internal optimizer (that performs no_inner_iterations). The total number of solver iterations in each planning cycle is therefore the product of both values.


### penalty_epsilon (double, default: 0.1)
  Add a small safety margin to penalty functions for hard-constraint approximations


### weight_max_vel_x (double, default: 2.0)
  Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed translational velocity


### weight_max_vel_theta (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed angular velocity


### weight_acc_lim_x (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed translational acceleration


### weight_acc_lim_theta (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for satisfying the maximum allowed angular acceleration


### weight_kinematics_nh (double, default: 1000.0)
  Optimization weight for satisfying the non-holonomic kinematics (this parameter must be high since the kinematics equation constitutes an equality constraint, even a value of 1000 does not imply a bad matrix condition due to small 'raw' cost values in comparison to other costs).


### weight_kinematics_forward_drive (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for forcing the robot to choose only forward directions (positive transl. velocities). A small weight (e.g. 1.0) still allows driving backwards. A value around 1000 almost prevents backward driving (but cannot be guaranteed).


### weight_kinematics_turning_radius (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for enforcing a minimum turning radius (only for carlike robots).


### weight_optimaltime (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for contracting the trajectory w.r.t transition/execution time


### weight_obstacle (double, default: 50.0)
  Optimization weight for keeping a minimum distance from obstacles


### weight_viapoint (double, default: 1.0)
  Optimization weight for minimzing the distance to via-points (resp. reference path). New in version 0.4


### weight_inflation (double, default: 0.1)
  Optimization weight for the inflation penalty (should be small).


### weight_adapt_factor (double, default: 2.0)
  Some special weights (currently weight_obstacle) are repeatedly scaled by this factor in each outer TEB iteration (weight_new = weight_old*factor). Increasing weights iteratively instead of setting a huge value a-priori leads to better numerical conditions of the underlying optimization problem.


## Parallel Planning in distinctive Topologies
### enable_homotopy_class_planning (bool, default: true)
  Activate parallel planning in distinctive topologies (requires much more CPU resources, since multiple trajectories are optimized at once)


### enable_multithreading (bool, default: true)
  Activate multiple threading in order to plan each trajectory in a different thread


### max_number_classes (int, default: 4)
  Specify the maximum number of distinctive trajectories taken into account (limits computational effort)

  Extra scaling of obstacle cost terms just for selecting the 'best' candidate.


### selection_viapoint_cost_scale (double, default: 1.0)
  Extra scaling of via-point cost terms just for selecting the 'best' candidate. New in version 0.4


### selection_alternative_time_cost (bool, default: false)

### roadmap_graph_no_samples (int, default: 15)
  Specify the number of samples generated for creating the roadmap graph

Warning: reduce this parameter only, if you observe problems with too many obstacles in the local cost map, do not choose it extremly low, otherwise obstacles cannot be distinguished from each other (0.2<value<=1).


### h_signature_threshold (double, default: 0.1)
  Two H-signatures are assumed to be equal, if both the difference of real parts and complex parts are below the specified threshold.


### obstacle_heading_threshold (double, default: 1.0)
  Specify the value of the scalar product between obstacle heading and goal heading in order to take them (obstacles) into account for exploration.


### visualize_hc_graph (bool, default: false)
  Visualize the graph that is created for exploring distinctive trajectories (check marker message in rviz)


### viapoints_all_candidates (bool, default: true)
  If true, all trajectories of different topologies are attached to the set of via-points, otherwise only the trajectory sharing the same topology as the initial/global plan is connected with them (no effect on test_optim_node). New in version 0.4
